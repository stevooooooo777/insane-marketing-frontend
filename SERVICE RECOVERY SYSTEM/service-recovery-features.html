# 🚀 Luxury Venue Intelligence Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: White-Glove Service Recovery (WEEKS 1-2) ✅ START HERE

### What You're Building
Real-time issue detection and instant response system that catches problems before guests leave.

### Technical Architecture

```
[Guest QR Interaction] 
    ↓
[Feedback Form/Rating]
    ↓
[Your Backend API]
    ↓
[Claude Sentiment Analysis] ← Already integrated!
    ↓
[Alert Decision Engine] ← NEW (simple rules)
    ↓
[Staff Notification System] ← NEW (SMS/Dashboard/Email)
    ↓
[Response Tracking Dashboard] ← NEW (manager view)
```

### Components to Build

#### 1. Alert Decision Engine (Backend)
```javascript
// Simple rules-based system
const shouldAlertStaff = (feedback) => {
  const alerts = [];
  
  // Rating-based alerts
  if (feedback.rating <= 2) {
    alerts.push({
      priority: 'URGENT',
      reason: 'Low rating detected',
      action: 'Immediate manager response required'
    });
  }
  
  // Sentiment analysis via Claude
  const sentiment = analyzeSentiment(feedback.comment);
  if (sentiment.negative > 0.7) {
    alerts.push({
      priority: 'HIGH',
      reason: 'Negative sentiment in feedback',
      keywords: sentiment.keywords
    });
  }
  
  // Issue keyword detection
  const issueKeywords = ['wait', 'cold', 'dirty', 'rude', 'noise', 'broken'];
  const hasIssue = issueKeywords.some(word => 
    feedback.comment.toLowerCase().includes(word)
  );
  
  if (hasIssue) {
    alerts.push({
      priority: 'MEDIUM',
      reason: 'Service issue detected',
      action: 'Staff follow-up recommended'
    });
  }
  
  return alerts;
};
```

#### 2. Claude Sentiment Analysis Integration
```javascript
// You already have Claude API - just add this function
const analyzeSentiment = async (feedbackText) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 500,
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: `Analyze this guest feedback sentiment and extract key issues. Return JSON only:

Feedback: "${feedbackText}"

Return format:
{
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "score": 0.0-1.0,
  "urgency": "low|medium|high|urgent",
  "issues": ["list", "of", "issues"],
  "keywords": ["important", "words"],
  "recommended_action": "what staff should do"
}`
      }]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const analysis = JSON.parse(data.content[0].text);
  return analysis;
};
```

#### 3. Staff Notification System
**Options (pick what works for your venues):**
- Dashboard popup (fastest to build)
- SMS via Twilio (most immediate)
- Email alerts (backup/documentation)
- Push notifications (mobile app)

#### 4. Manager Response Dashboard
Simple interface showing:
- Active issues requiring attention
- Guest details (location, suite, name)
- Issue summary
- Response options ("Resolved", "In Progress", "Escalated")
- Time since alert (urgency indicator)

### Database Schema Additions

```sql
-- Feedback Alerts Table
CREATE TABLE feedback_alerts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  feedback_id INT,
  guest_id INT,
  venue_location VARCHAR(255),
  priority ENUM('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH', 'URGENT'),
  issue_type VARCHAR(255),
  sentiment_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  keywords JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  responded_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  responded_by INT NULL,
  resolution_notes TEXT NULL,
  status ENUM('PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'RESOLVED', 'ESCALATED')
);

-- Response Tracking
CREATE TABLE alert_responses (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  alert_id INT,
  staff_id INT,
  response_time_seconds INT,
  action_taken TEXT,
  guest_satisfied BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Success Metrics to Track
- Average response time (target: < 2 minutes)
- Issue resolution rate (target: > 90%)
- Guest satisfaction recovery (1-star → 5-star conversions)
- Staff response patterns

---

## Phase 2: VIP Recognition Engine (WEEKS 3-5)

### What You're Building
Automatic guest recognition system that briefs staff before interaction.

### Technical Architecture

```
[Guest Check-In/QR Scan]
    ↓
[Guest Identification] (email, phone, or guest ID)
    ↓
[Historical Data Query] ← Your existing analytics
    ↓
[Claude Pattern Analysis] ← Profile generation
    ↓
[Staff Briefing Card] ← Real-time display
```

### Components to Build

#### 1. Guest Profile Database
```javascript
const guestProfile = {
  id: "guest_12345",
  name: "Sarah Mitchell",
  totalVisits: 3,
  firstVisit: "2024-08-15",
  lastVisit: "2025-09-20",
  
  preferences: {
    dietary: ["no seafood", "vegetarian options"],
    drinks: ["champagne", "red wine - Malbec"],
    seating: ["window seat", "quiet area"],
    temperature: "prefers warmer rooms"
  },
  
  pastOrders: [
    {date: "2025-09-20", items: ["Filet Mignon", "Dom Perignon"]},
    {date: "2025-07-10", items: ["Vegetarian Pasta", "Malbec"]}
  ],
  
  specialOccasions: [
    {type: "anniversary", date: "2025-09-20"}
  ],
  
  feedback: [
    {date: "2025-09-20", rating: 5, comment: "Perfect evening!"},
    {date: "2025-07-10", rating: 4, comment: "Slight wait for table"}
  ],
  
  lifetimeValue: 2450.00,
  averageSpend: 816.67,
  
  alerts: ["seafood allergy - CRITICAL"]
};
```

#### 2. Claude Profile Generation
```javascript
const generateStaffBriefing = async (guestProfile) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 300,
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: `Generate a concise staff briefing for this returning guest. Focus on actionable insights.

Guest Data:
${JSON.stringify(guestProfile, null, 2)}

Return format:
{
  "greeting": "Warm, personalized greeting suggestion",
  "critical_info": ["MUST KNOW items (allergies, complaints, etc)"],
  "conversation_starters": ["Natural talking points"],
  "upsell_opportunities": ["Based on past preferences"],
  "service_notes": ["How to make this visit exceptional"]
}`
      }]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return JSON.parse(data.content[0].text);
};
```

#### 3. Staff Briefing Interface
Real-time card that appears when guest checks in:

```

## Phase 3: Real-Time Upsell Intelligence (WEEKS 6-8)

### What You're Building
AI that identifies upsell opportunities during the guest experience.

### Technical Architecture

```
[Guest Activity Stream] ← QR scans, orders, movement
    ↓
[Behavioral Pattern Analysis]
    ↓
[Claude Decision Engine] ← "Should we suggest X?"
    ↓
[Upsell Recommendation] ← Specific, timely suggestions
    ↓
[Staff Alert + Guest Offer]
```

### Behavioral Triggers

```javascript
const upsellTriggers = {
  // Multiple orders = high engagement
  multipleOrders: {
    threshold: 2,
    within_minutes: 30,
    suggestion: "Premium experience upgrade"
  },
  
  // Premium items = money is not object
  premiumItems: {
    keywords: ["champagne", "premium", "deluxe", "VIP"],
    suggestion: "Next-tier upgrade"
  },
  
  // Celebration signals
  celebration: {
    keywords: ["birthday", "anniversary", "celebrate"],
    or_multiple_champagne: true,
    suggestion: "Special occasion package"
  },
  
  // Extended stay = enjoying experience
  longDuration: {
    threshold_minutes: 90,
    suggestion: "Extended experience or return booking"
  },
  
  // Social sharing = brand advocate
  socialSharing: {
    photos_taken: 3,
    suggestion: "Exclusive experience for social media"
  }
};
```

### Claude Upsell Decision Engine

```javascript
const analyzeUpsellOpportunity = async (guestActivity) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 400,
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: `Analyze this guest behavior and recommend upsell opportunities.

Guest Activity:
${JSON.stringify(guestActivity, null, 2)}

Venue Upsell Options:
- Premium Suite Upgrade (+£150)
- VIP Experience Package (+£200)
- Private Chef Table (+£300)
- Return Visit Booking (10% discount)
- Exclusive Merchandise Package (+£75)

Return JSON:
{
  "should_upsell": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Why this guest is/isn't ready",
  "best_offer": "Which upsell to suggest",
  "timing": "now|in_15min|at_dessert|before_leaving",
  "approach": "How staff should present it",
  "expected_conversion": "low|medium|high"
}`
      }]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return JSON.parse(data.content[0].text);
};
```
