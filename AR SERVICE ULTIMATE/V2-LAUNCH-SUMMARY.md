## 💼 For Your Hotel Pitches

### The Demo Script (5 min):

**"Let me show you something no other hospitality tech platform has..."**

1. **Open AR interface on phone**
   "Guest wants drinks poolside - watch what happens"

2. **Select Drinks category**
   "System knows it's 11am poolside, recommends fresh juices and iced coffee"

3. **But guest wants cocktails instead**
   "No problem - full flexibility. All options available."

4. **Customize the order**
   "5 cocktails - 3 Mojitos, 2 Piña Coladas, light ice"
   "Add dietary preferences - vegan option"
   "Timing - now, or schedule for 3pm"

5. **Capture request**
   "Staff receives: photo of exact lounger, detailed order, VIP status, GPS coordinates"

6. **Switch to staff dashboard** (optional)
   "One-tap fulfillment, response time tracked, service quality metrics"

**Pause for effect**

"This isn't AR menus. This is operational intelligence that drives revenue while delivering precision service."

## 🎨 What Makes V2 Special

### Design:
- **Luxury hospitality aesthetic** (gold & navy, not tech blue)
- Elegant typography (Cormorant Garamond + Montserrat)
- Refined animations and micro-interactions
- Feels like a premium hotel app, not a startup product

### Intelligence:
- **Time-aware**: Different recommendations for breakfast vs dinner
- **Location-aware**: Poolside vs suite vs garden context
- **Guest-aware**: Remembers preferences (when integrated with backend)
- **Weather-aware**: Hot day → suggests cold drinks (when integrated)

### Flexibility:
- **Category-based**: Drinks, Food, Transport, Service, Amenities, Other
- **Custom everything**: Quantity, notes, dietary, timing
- **Smart defaults**: But never restrictive

### Data Quality:
Staff receives:
```
Category: Drinks
Item: Frozen Cocktails  
Quantity: 5
Notes: "3 Mojitos, 2 Piña Coladas, extra ice"
Dietary: Vegan
Timing: Now
Location: Photo + GPS of exact spot
Guest: Suite 101 (VIP)
Priority: High
```

**vs. competitors:**
```
"Champagne request"
```
